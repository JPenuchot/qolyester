* Fix bugs. =)

* Finish commenting the code (yes, shame on me again).

* Implement <put your favorite option here>.

* Implement funky QoS support: this is the main purpose of this
  project (actually this is the Q in Qolyester).  We are currently
  doing it on an internal branch of the project and intend to release
  it when usable (this might be some long time).

* Finish enabling optional feature disabling by autoconf switches.

* Implement a real, pluggable, DOT file parser for the switch.

* Find a good way to deal with potentially conflicting routes existing when
  Qolyester starts.

* Use the boost C++ library to implement most of the ugly stuff.
