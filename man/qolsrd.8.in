.SH NAME
qolsrd \- Qolyester
.SM OLSR
daemon @virtual_version@
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B qolsrd -i \fIinterface\fR[,...] [\fIOPTION\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B qolsrd
is the Qolyester daemon.  Qolyester is an implementation of the
Optimized Link-State Routing (\f(SMOLSR\fR) protocol for mobile ad hoc
networks.@virtual_description@

Dump the internal state every second.
.TP
\fB--dump-prof\fR
Prints the time in seconds spent in each event loop.
.TP
\fB--debug-trace=FILE\fR
Activates all the options required to produce a trace file used for bug
reporting.

.SH BUGS
There are certainly lots of bugs left.  Please let me know.
.sp
Qolyester only runs on Linux kernel 2.4 series for the moment, porting
to *BSD is not my primary concern, but any external help in this
direction is welcome.
